# Etopa
### Time-based one-time password authenticator (2FA)
Etopa is a two-factor-authentication app, which runs as a web server and can be accessed using a web browser or using an app.
It is currently under development. If you want to contribute and encounter problems, feel free to ask me for help anytime.
The setup is a bit complicated, so I haven't written an instructions page for contributors yet.
